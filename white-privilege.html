			<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>hite Privilege refers to the advantages white people have due to living in a society constructed to favour them. Of course - and like privilege more generally - White Privilege is not something you earn but something you're born into, just as we were born with white skin.</p>
			<p>Being classified as "white" provides social advantages not shared by people with black or brown skin. It can mean, for instance:</p>
			<div class="popout-box-styling">
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>I can turn on the TV, open a magazine, search for an image online, buy birthday cards, and so on, and see people who look like me widely and positively represented.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>When I learn or am reminded about our national history, or even about that of "civilization", I will be shown that people who look like me made it what it is.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I can buy plasters and easily have them more or less match my skin colour.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>If I move house, I can be pretty sure my new neighbours will be neutral or pleasant to me.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>If I need financial help, I can be sure my skin colour won't negatively affect my chances of receiving it.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I am more likely to be hired and promoted than a Black or brown contemporary, and my wage will likely be higher for comparable jobs.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>At work, I can be pretty confident I won't be challenged about my natural hair shape or the way I manage it.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I can be angry, dress and eat messily, run quickly, swim poorly and not have these attributed to my race.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I can be successful and not be considered a credit to my race; and I am never asked to speak - or speak out - on behalf of my race.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>When I go shopping I can be pretty confident I won't be followed by security.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I can be pretty confident I won't be stopped and searched by the police. I am less likely to be killed by the police than if I were Black or brown. I am less likely to be convicted of a crime than I would if I were Black or brown - and, if I am convicted, the sentence I receive is likely to be smaller. I am less likely to go to prison.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>I won't have my citizenship challenged.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>These are just a few of the ways in which I am advantaged because I have white skin.</p>
			<p>Just because we have White Privilege doesn't mean you haven't worked hard for your achievements. However, you would have had to work far harder to achieve the same success had you been born Black or brown. And just because we have White Privilege doesn't mean you haven't faced hardship, difficulty or sadness in your life. It's just that our skin colour isn't one of the things making life harder, and the privileges we have can help us overcome or recover in ways unavailable to those without White Privilege.</p>
			<p>In some ways, it's not our fault that we experience advantages because of our skin colour. After all, it's something we're born into. Rather, we experience these advantages because for many years our society has been run by people like us and there are inherent - conscious and unconscious - biases and prejudices built into the way society works. Society is set up in a way that privileges, that gives advantages to, white people - and thereby disadvantages racialised people. White Privilege, then, is the result of a society biased for and against certain races - i.e., White Privilege comes from a racist society, a White supremacist society.</p>
			<p>Because the advantages are such a normal part of our lives, often it's hard for us to see the privileges we experience as white people. It can also be hard to have our privileges pointed out, as it can feel like a personal attack. This is part of what it means to have White Fragility (which we'll consider shortly), which goes hand in hand with White Privilege.</p>
			<p>It can be even harder to let go of our privileges by making changes to how society is structured - it's hard to let go of something that benefits you. Those of us with White Privilege may react with anger when our privilege is challenged. This reaction is known as white rage or white backlash and it leads to actions to secure our position of advantage. These are White supremacist actions - i.e., actions seeking to secure the dominance of white people in society.</p>
			<p>Of course, there are other, anti-racist ways to respond to having our privilege pointed out, which we'll consider later. Next, however, we'll think about the other side of the coin to white privilege: racism.</p>
