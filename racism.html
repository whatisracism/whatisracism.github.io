			<p class="abstract">Racism is more than hostility from one person to another. Racism also works in and between institutions like the criminal justice system, housing, banking, education, etc.</p>
			<p><span class="drop-cap">R</span>acism is discrimination from people in a position of power against another person or group of people because of the race they are categorised as. Our society is organised in such a way that white people have certain advantages, dominate and generally have better life outcomes than those in racialised minorities - i.e., even if individual white people don't feel it, white people are in a position of power over racialised minorities. It's uncomfortable to hear, but we live in a white supremacist society, a society that puts white people at the top of a social hierarchy.</p>
			<p>Racism can be expressed in different ways. Someone might be overtly racist, for instance, attacking or verbally abusing somebody because of the colour of their skin. Or it could be more subtle, perhaps unconscious: someone might feel unsafe if a person of colour is sitting near them on the bus but, if asked why they feel that way, might not be able to articulate their fears. Racism can be systemic and institutional too. For example, if a white person and a Black or Asian person are arrested for comparable drug offences, the Black or Asian person is more likely to be jailed - and for longer - than the white person. The police stop and search more Black people than white, even though they are more likely to find reasons for further action after stopping and searching white people. This is true over multiple years because racism is entrenched in the criminal justice system.</p>
			<p>The financial system is also biased against Black people - i.e., it's racist. For example, Black victims of fraud are more than twice as likely to be denied a refund by their bank than a white customer. It's also harder for Black people to access loans for starting businesses.</p>
			<p>In the job market, Black and brown workers are less likely to be hired; and employees from racialised minorities earn on average 10% to 20% less than their white colleagues.</p>
			<p>Year on year, Black and brown people make up a disproportionately large number of those homeless. Black and brown people are 75% more likely than white people to experience housing deprivation. Within the current housing crisis, Black people are particularly held back from owning their own home.</p>
			<p>People of all ages are affected by institutional racism. British teachers, for instance, are less likely to enter their Black Caribbean pupils into higher tier exams than their white pupils, even if the pupils have the same grades in their previous work. This is an institutionalised racism that holds lower expectations for these Black kids and, by doing so, it holds them back.</p>
			<p>The examples above are not comprehensive. In every area of society, people from racialised minorities are disadvantaged and discriminated against. As our society is prejudiced against racialised minorities it is a racist society. Racism is the other side of the coin to White Privilege: while not always a zero-sum game (if police stopped disproportionately killing Black people, they possibly wouldn't start killing more white people), white people are often advantaged at the expense of racialised minorities.</p>
			<p>So racism isn't just individual prejudices someone might have towards a person because of the colour of their skin; it's also systemic and institutional, built into the way society works.</p>
			<p>It's uncomfortable to hear, but all white people are racist. Fundamentally, this isn't because we're bad people, but because we are born into and grow up in a racist society, one that prioritises white people and devalues people from racialised minorities. The environment you grow up in has an effect on who you are, and we can't help absorbing racial prejudices from our society and the impression that white people are the benchmark of normality. Being taught racism by society in this way might not turn us into overt racists who join racist organisations, but it will affect us - it's not something we can escape and it negatively affects our views of and interactions with people from racialised minorities in ways we're often unaware of. While we'll never be able to lose all of the racism we've absorbed from society, it is something we can make efforts to unlearn, resist and fight against.</p>
			<p>Another critical way white people's inherent racism can be expressed is through inaction. We might not be overtly racist; we might even be trying to reduce our own individual expressions of racism: but if we're aren't actively trying to work against the racism in society we're still being racist because we don't see the lives of people from racialised minorities as important enough to fight for. </p>
			<p>Sometimes white people might talk about "reverse racism", racism towards themselves or white people generally. This might be said when people from racialised minorities are pointing out the racism of white people and society. To claim "reverse racism" in this instance isn't a fair thing to do, to say the least: it equates pointing out historic and current racial inequalities with those oppressions themselves. In fact, responding in this way is revealing: if you are more angry about people pointing out racism than the racism itself, it's a sign you're part of the problem (i.e., a racist), and it proves we don't understand the realities of racism.</p>
			<p>Further, because racism includes an element of power over someone, racism isn't something white people can experience from people from racialised minorities because it is white people who are in the position of power in society. Consider bullying: when someone fights back against a bully, calling them names and even hitting them, that's not "reverse bullying" but self-defence and seeking justice. Or consider derogatory words: if a white person uses the n-word, it is loaded with a history of racial oppression, violence and slavery; if a Black person calls a white person a cracker or a honky, it doesn't have those connotations of power and abuse and it comes from a person or people who still face oppression because of their race.</p>
			<p>When you begin to understand the racism experienced by people of colour, anti-white feeling becomes understandable. When white society has devalued, disadvantaged, abused and brutalised you for hundreds of years, responding with suspicion and caution makes sense - and can even save your life.</p>
