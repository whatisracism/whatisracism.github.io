			<p class="abstract">Reflections on the terminology used on this site.</p>
			<p><span class="drop-cap">M</span>any of the commonly used terms when talking about culture, ethnicity, race, racism and inequality are problematic. BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethinic) and BME (Black and minority ethnic), for instance, can be near meaningless because they group people together who have different cultures and experiences of inequality and racism. For example, in the US police disproportionately kill Black people particularly - and hence why Black Lives Matter developed particularly. When talking about experiences of racism, then, wherever necessary and possible, referring to an individual's or a group's "race" is preferred.</p>
			<p>Terms like BAME/BME also suffer from something clearly seen in the use of the term "non-white", placing everything in contrast to "white", as if white was the centre, what is to be considered "normal". The term "minorities" can share this problem, and has inaccurate connotations of weakness and powerlessness. It also disguises the fact white people are the global minority, which can reinforce white notions of "normality". This last point reveals another problem with "minority": while white people might be the global minority, that doesn't put them in a subordinate position when it comes to exploitation and power - just as the white minority in aparthide South Africa were in a domineering position. "Minority" is relative to its context.</p>
			<p>As we'll see in the section on Understanding race, "race" itself is a problematic term. Races, we'll see, aren't things that exist biologically, but are things that exist in our understanding of society because they've been developed as an (exceedingly inaccurate and damaging) way of categorising the world. When someone is categorised as belonging in a "race", they are actually being racialised, conceptually turned into someone who's placed in a constructed idea of what a particular race is.</p>
			<p>"People of colour" is increasingly used in the UK and can refer to Black, Asian, East Asian, South East Asian, Latinx, etc. people. It's seen as more empowering than "non-white" and "minority" because it doesn't prioritise whiteness and doesn't connotate weakness. As racism from white Britons is directed at people of colour and also people who might have white skin but are racialised in other ways (e.g., Gypsies, Roma, Jews) a broader term is needed for this website.</p>
			<p>For these reasons, throughout this website (with its context of having been written for white British people to help us understand racism) the terms we use most often are "white" (to refer to ourselves) and "racialised minorities" (to refer to people we have racialised and minoritised). More specific adjectives - like Black and Asian - are used when issues are mentioned that affect different people in different ways depending on how they have been racialised.</p>
			<p>Terms like !historically excluded groups" could be useful alternatives, but as this website focuses on racism (as opposed to the sexism, transphobia, abilism, etc., that is directed as other historically exluded groups) "racialised minorities" is preferred.</p>
