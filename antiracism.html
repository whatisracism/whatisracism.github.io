			<blockquote> What's the problem with being "not racist"? It is a claim that signifies neutrality: "I am not a racist, but neither am I aggressively against racism". But there is no neutrality in the racism struggle. ... One either allows racial inequalities to persevere, as a racist, or confronts racial inequalities, as an antiracist.
				<br>
				<div class="text-align-r">—<strong>Ibram X. Kendi</strong></div>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The passivity of being "not raicst" - "neutral" in a racist society - is the privilege of a racist, someone who doesn't care about the lives of racialised minorities. In short, being "not racist" is racist.</p>
			<p>As racism won't skulk back on it's own, and will be emboldened and expand if it meets no resistance, we need to be anti-racist, actively against racism whenever and wherever it's exists.</p>
			<p>By working through this website you've already taken steps towards anti-racism. Below are some steps to take to continue (this guide is based on those produced by a number of people from Black communities and other anti-racists - see the references on the sources page).</p>
			<h3 id="listen">Listen</h3>
			<p>We've got so much to learn. Listen to people from racialised minorities, as living in the hostile environment of the UK is their reality. Listen to people you know from racialised minorities; attend lecures; listen to podcasts; watching films by people from racialised minorities about race and their experiences. (See the <a href="resources.html#listen">resources page</a> for some examples of where to start.) </p>
			<h3 id="uncomfortable">Learn to be uncomfortable</h3>
			<p>We are complicit in or benefit from racism in the UK, and we're so oblivious to the realities of racism that, at the least, we'll do racist things without even knowing. Be prepared to have this pointed out. It'll be embarrassing and awkward, but don't react with rage or walk away. It's an opportunity to learn. Apologise when you make mistakes and then get back involved in the work for racial justice. Fail forwards. (Perhaps start with Layla Saad's <a href="https://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/titles/layla-saad/me-and-white-supremacy/9781529405088/" target="_blank"><cite>Me and White Supremacy</cite></a> and Robin DiAngelo's <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/313/313406/white-fragility/9780141990569.html" target="_blank"><cite>White Fragility</cite></a>.)</p>
			<h3>Keep learning</h3>
			<p>This website is only an introduction, but we need life-long learning. Learn the history of British racist oppression. Learn about contemporary racist policies and attitudes. Learn about "whiteness". Learn from the continuing history of anti-racist resistance. Learn from the histories of racialised minorities within British history and within the world - our view of the history is artificially white. We can't expect people from racialised minorities to spoon feed us, we need to take responsibility for our own education. (<a href="experiences.html">Resources</a>.)</p>
			<h3 id="whiteness">Learn about yourself (analysis your whiteness)</h3>
			<p>We're not used to thinking about ourselves in "racial" terms, but reflecting on our own racism and place in a racist society that benefits us will give us more understanding of how our world works and help us keep our racism in check. Perhaps start with Layla F. Saad's <a href="https://www.quercusbooks.co.uk/titles/layla-saad/me-and-white-supremacy/9781529405088/" target="_blank"><em>White Supremacy and Me</em></a> and DiAngelo's <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/313/313406/white-fragility/9780141990569.html" target="_blank"><em>White Fragility</em></a>. Learn about your bias, too. Start by taking the <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html" target="_blank">Harvard Implicit Project</a> test on race.</p>
			<h3 id="ally">Learn about being an ally and accomplice (not a "white saviour")</h3>
			<p>Learn about what it means to be a White Saviour - and don't be this! Rather, be an <a href="https://twitter.com/iKaylaReed/status/742243143030972416" target="_blank">ally</a> and an accomplice. Start with Amanda Seales's video <a href="https://youtu.be/WBYTxzuGiYc" target="_blank">White Savior vs Ally</a> (4:15) and Afua Hirsch and Reggie Yate's Pass the Mic conversation about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCLXK17Dbdi/" target="_blank">Allyship</a> (13:10). Learn the practical <a href="https://www.whiteaccomplices.org/" target="_blank">difference between being an "actor", an "ally" and an "accomplice"</a>. (Also see this guide to <a href="https://guidetoallyship.com" target="_blank">guide to allyship</a>.)</p>
			<h3>Step back</h3>
			<p>We're used to being heard, and used to marginalising people from racialised minorities, so it can be hard for us to step back, but people from racialised minorities are experienced in this area so they don't need us butting to the front (that would be another moment of white supremacy). We are not the saviours.</p>
			<h3>Follow</h3>
			<p>The whole direction of anti-racist work should be directed by the people it effects. They know best the disease and the cure. Follow their lead.</p>
			<h3>Amplify the voices of people from racialised minorities</h3>
			<p>Racialised people from racialised minority communities are best placed to talk about the experience of racism in the UK, so amplify their voices on this issue. The perspectives of people from racialised minorities are often missing from society's conversation altogether, which makes for an impoverished conversation, so boost the voices of racialised minorities on every topic.</p>
			<h3>Be intersectional</h3>
			<p>Being "intersectional" means recognising that some people experience a number of different prejudices at the same time (the prejudices intersect on an individual/group). A Black woman, for example, will experience both racism and sexism; a Black, transgender, disabled, lesbian women will experience racism, transphobia, ableism, lesbophobia and sexism. When we say something like Black Lives Matter and live like we mean it, we must include all of those lives, whatever shape they take, and fight the various prejudices. We'll find, too, the truth that Black feminist activist have been teaching us for years: "nobody's free until everybody's free". Seeing things intersectionally also helps us realise that someone might experience racism in multiple aspects of their life: housing, health, education, employment, etc.</p>
			<h3 id="communities">Support racialised minority communities</h3>
			<p>Buy from businesses owned by people from racialised minorities. If you can, support charities and organisations run and founded by racialised minorities. Buy from and highlight creators from racialised minorities. (<a href="resources.html#communities">Resources</a>.)</p>
			<h3 id="boycott">Boycott</h3>
			<p>Boycott media, organisations and companies that promote racism, along with those that benefit from the cultures of racialised minorities but don't take action on issues affecting them. (Drunk Magazine has a list <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CA8VE34jmDJ/" target="_blank">here</a> (June 2020).)</p>
			<h3 id="campaigns">Support campaigns</h3>
			<p>There are many organisations working against racism in its various guises: prison and police abolition; in education; climate justice; housing; etc.. Sign their petitions, share their output, join their protests. (It you're joining a physical protest, learn about protesting - and follow the lead of the racialised minority members of the protest.) (<a href="resources.html#campaigns">Resources</a>.)</p>
			<h3>Donate money</h3>
			<p>Anti-racist work is up against a big foe: racism in all the attitudes, institutions and structures in the UK and around the globe. It's going to need resources and, if we're able, we need to put our money where our mouth is and donate to groups dedicated to opposing racism. (<a href="resources.html#campaigns">Resources</a>.)</p>
			<h3>Volunteer</h3>
			<p>Find an anti-racist organisation (making sure the organisation involves people affected by racism) and ask how you can help. (<a href="resources.html#campaigns">Resources</a>.)</p>
			<h3 id="check-in">Check in with friends, family and colleagues</h3>
			<p>Traumatic, racist events can affect individuals and whole communities. Check in with people you know who are affected. As you do, remember not to centre yourself (it's not about us; expressions of grief, apologies and offloading guilt aren't what's needed). You don't need to ask if they're "doing okay". Make yourself available instead. (<a href="resources.html#check-in">Advice</a>.)</p>
			<h3 id="inclusive">Be inclusive</h3>
			<p>When organising things make a serious effort to include people from racialised minorities. So often a panel, a TV show, a workplace, a charity event - anything! - is just white faces. Being inclusive involves removing barriers that might stop someone from a racialised minority community from engaging (these could be financial barriers, transportation barriers, childcare barriers, etc.). (<a href="resources.html#inclusive">Resources</a>.)</p>
			<h3 id="speak">Speak out</h3>
			<p>Bring up and talk about racism and anti-racism amongst your white friends, family, and colleagues. Speak out against both individual and systemic racism whenever you encounter it. Remember to not just talk about inequalities faced by racialised communities, but also that racism is our problem, a problem us white people cause. (But don't speak over people from racialised minorities!) (<a href="resources.html#speak">Advice</a>.)</p>
			<h3 id="intervene">Intervene</h3>
			<p>If you see someone being racially abused, intervene. Learn how to intervene well: <a href="https://vimeo.com/199947156" target="_blank">video</a> (3:53) &#x2767; <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20171005/splc-campus-guide-bystander-intervention" target="_blank">guide</a>.</p>
			<h3 id="use-privilege">Use your privilege</h3>
			<p>Our white privilege grants us access to opportunities and spaces that are not available to people from racialised minorities. When appropriate, use your privileged position to advocate for people from racialised minorities and their communities. Our whiteness is also something that gives us more safety in some situations. There might be times we need to get in the way of a racist advance. (<a href="resources.html#use-privilege">Advice</a>.)</p>
			<h3 id="parliament">Write to your MP and vote</h3>
			<p>Write to your MP and demand change (you can find your MP <a href="https://www.writetothem.com/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://members.parliament.uk/FindYourMP" target="_blank">here</a>). Find out about parliamentary candiates' <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/" target="_blank">voting records and opinions</a>, and those of the party the stand for, and vote for the one who will most help racialised communities.</p>
			<h3 id="media">Make your media intake more normal</h3>
			<p>Decolonise and normalise your media intake by reading, listening to, watching, looking at work by creators from racialised minorities. (<a href="resources.html#media">Suggestions to start with</a>.)</p>
			<h3 id="resources">Familiarise yourself with resources</h3>
			<p>The resources mentioned on this website make up just a very few of those available. Familiarise yourself with what's around and keep learning. (<a href="resources.html#resources">Resource lists</a>.)</p>
			<h3 id="kids">Teach your kids</h3>
			<p>People are never too young to begin to learn about racism and anti-racism. (<a href="resources.html#kids">Resources</a>.)</p>
			<h3>Keep going - do the work</h3>
			<p>Whether new or old when it comes to thinking about racism, keep going. Racism has a long history in the UK and is deeply entrenched in all levels of our society. It's not going to go away on its own; it's not going to go without a struggle. And it's serious: people are dying because of it, people are killed by it. So keep going. We have an obligation to because racism is our problem, developed by white people and built into British society by white people.</p>
			<p>Part of our privilege as white people is that racism doesn't affect us, so it's all too easy to ignore it, forget about it, or be distracted. Racialised minorities don't have that option. So we need to keep aware and keep going. It's long, hard, important work. Keep going.</p>
