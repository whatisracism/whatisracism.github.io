			<p class="abstract">What is race? How does it affect the way we see the world? How does it affect the way the world works?</p>
			<p><span class="drop-cap">B</span>ehind the idea of "race" in racism is the notion humans can be divided into distinct groups that each have fundamental characteristics not shared by the other groups. These characteristics are said to be visible in how people look, how their bodies function, and how they behave. The characteristics are then given value (on a scale, for example, of physical, cultural, intellectual, or moral prowess) resulting in the races being ranked, with some judged superior to - in effect, more human than - others.</p>
			<p>The idea of these neat categories of "race" is childishly simplistic and scientifically illiterate, however: it doesn't map onto the reality of historical or contemporary human existence.</p>
			<p>Human life began in Africa a relatively short time ago, in the grand scheme of things. Racists might not like it, but all humans are of African descent. Over time, humans gradually extended the area in which they lived, all the while our genes continuing to mix with each other as people moved back and forth. As we moved to different geographies, we adapted to the environments we were now in - but we were still one "race". The variations that occurred in the different geographies were a process, and genetically tiny (today, all humans are so genetically similar we have less genetic variation than is found in apes - or bananas). As a species, we're too young for anything significant to have changed between us. And many of the variations did not stay contained in the geographies that had helped produce them: they circulated around the broader human gene pool as people continued to move about and have sex. And so, naturally, the majority of human form, ability and behaviour is consistent wherever you go, with small variations in, for instance, the colour of our eyes, hair or skin. Humankind has always been an ever changing mix, migrating, having sex. And this is true culturally, as well: it's not just genes that are shared, but ideas and skills. The supposedly distinct races are more like a group of overlapping smudges, blending into each other. We're indivisible because we're all a big, smugding group.</p>
			<p>Rather than being something that exists, then, "race" is something some people have tried to squeeze humankind into, with people being racialised. Sometimes we get a very clear glimpse of the process of racialisation, which shows how arbitrary and fabricated "races" are. Let's consider the idea of the "white race" as an example.</p>
			<p>For many years, British racists have considered peoples from Indian, Pakistan, Aghanistan, Iran, and other countries in Asia as belonging to a different "race" as Europeans; however, in earlier categorisations of the world, that wasn't the case. Currently in the US, people from the Middle East and North Africa are included in "white" in some official systems, which is different to notions of whiteness in the UK - as well as everyday notions of whiteness in the US, for that matter. In some parts of the twentieth-century US, people who had one Black ancestor (so, perhaps someone with one Black great-great-grandparent, making them an "sixteenth Black", so to speak) were considered Black, even though they might "look white" - this would likely make some white supremacists "Black". Today in the UK and US someone with one Black and one white parent is racialised as Black. Mexican Americans have been classified as "white", then "not white", then "white" again - the change to "not white" happened when the US government wanted to decrease the number of people in the labour market. The categories people are assigned to change at different times depending on the notions of the day, which demonstrates that there really aren't fixed things as "races" and that races are constructed by humans - typically, by those with power over others so that they can control, ignore, abuse, or even kill those they categorise as different from themselves. This can be graphically seen in the history of slavery, for example, where people with white skin categorised people with black skin as inferior, subhuman, allowing themselves to use and abuse Black people.</p>
			<p>This racialisation isn't confined to the past. In British history, those constructing the "race" categories, assigning others to them and brutalising those people, has been us whites. This has meant that we have been able to set up society in a way that continues to push down the people we racialise and gives ourselves an advantage at their expense. We've been able to make a society that privileges us.</p>
			<p>Before we consider how society privileges us white people, in the next section we'll get some grounding by considering privilege more generally.</p>
