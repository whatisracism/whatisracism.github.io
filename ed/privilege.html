<h1>Understanding privilege</h1>
</div><!-- /.blurb -->
<p>Privilege is an advantage a person or group of people has that they did not earn. It’s usually something they’re born into.</p>
<p>Privilege is most usually associated with wealth. A person born into a rich family generally has advantages others do not to the same degree: access to more personalised tuition; more, diverse and higher quality leisure experiences; better, more secure housing; as well as more immediate access to health care; and so on.</p>
<p>Just because you are privileged doesn’t mean you haven’t worked hard for your achievements. However, you would have had to work far harder to achieve the same success without your privilege. And just because you are privileged doesn’t mean you haven’t faced hardship, difficulty or sadness in your life. It’s just that the resources you have can help you overcome or recover in ways unavailable to those without your privilege.</p>
<p>Privilege does not only come from wealth. As well as conferring wealth, class privilege (i.e., if you are born into an “upper” or even “middle class” family) may mean you have access to a network of associations with contacts in various businesses, allowing for greater job opportunities, for instance.</p>
<p>Able-bodied privilege is another we could consider: our society is constructed in a way that functions most easily for able-bodied people. This puts disabled people at a disadvantage in society. It’s important to realise that privilege can often come at the disadvantage of others.</p>
<p>People can benefit from more than one privilege. An able-bodied person from a wealthy, upper class family is benefitting from being born into various privileges.</p>
Because they are such a normal part of some people’s lives, often it’s hard for them to see the privileges they have. It can also be hard to have your privileges pointed out, as it can feel like a personal attack. And it can be even harder to let go of those privileges by making changes to how society is structured - it’s hard to let go of something that benefits you. Those with privilege may react with anger when their privilege is challenged and take actions to secure their position.</p>
